## Usage

The main function expects an options object with `src` and `dest` properties, and returns a promise.

```js
var hekyll = require('{%= name %}');
hekyll(options);
```

**Options**

- `src`: the directory with source files for a Jekyll theme.
- `dest`: the destination path for the converted theme.

**Example**

```js
hekyll({src: 'themes/poole', dest: 'src'})
  .then(function() {
    console.log('finished!');
  })
  .catch(console.error);
```

## Choosing a theme

~20 jekyll themes were tested during the creation of this library, including all of the [poole/poole themes](https://github.com/poole/poole) from [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo), and all of the built-in [gh-pages themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/). Most themes convert flawlessly, but some have nuances that might require some manual editing. 

**Handlebars helpers**

To be able to render the migrated templates with handlebars, you will first need to include any missing handlebars helpers that were converted from liquid filters and tags during the migration. 

Here are some libraries that might be useful for this:

- [template-helpers][] - generic helpers that can be used with any template engine.
- [handlebars-helpers][] - more than 150 handlebars helpers 


**Bug reports**

If you find a bug or something that doesn't convert correctly, [please let me know](../../issues/new), I want this to work as seamlessly as possible.
