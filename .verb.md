## Usage

```js
var hekyll = require('{%= name %}');
```

## Steps

### 1. Install hekyll 

Git clone this library, <kbd>cd</kbd> into the project, then install its dependencies using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) with this single command:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jonschlinkert/hekyll.git && cd hekyll && npm install hekyll
```

### 2. Clone the theme you want

Clone the theme you want into the `vendor` directory, or whatever directory you prefer. 

**Example: poole theme**

For example, to clone the popular [poole theme](https://github.com/poole/poole), from @mdo do:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/poole/poole.git vendor/poole
```

**Example: caymen theme**

For example, to clone the popular [jekyll-caymen-theme](https://github.com/pietromenna/jekyll-cayman-theme), do:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/pietromenna/jekyll-cayman-theme.git vendor/caymen
```

**Example: minima theme**

Or to clone jekyll's [minima-theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) do:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jekyll/minima.git vendor/minima
```

### 3. Convert the theme

Before you can customize and build your site, you'll need to convert the jekyll site and liquid templates over to use [assemble][] and [handlebars][] templates:

```sh
$ assemble hekyll
```

### 4. Customize and build!

Liquid templates have have been converted handlebars, and the plugin has attempted to convert most of the configuration settings, assets and other non-template files as well. 

You should now be able to build the site at any time with the following command:

```sh
$ assemble
```

## Please help improve this project

As with any site, you'll need to make some customizations, and potentially fix any remaining issues that were missed by the plugin. If you find a bug, or any that doesn't work, and you think this plugin should handle it, please [don't hesitate to create an issue](../../issues/new).
