> Migrate Jekyll (gh-pages) themes to use handlebars instead of liquid.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save hekyll
```

## Usage

To run hekyll, you will need to pass an instance of [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) or [assemble](https://github.com/assemble/assemble). This allows you to override any of hekyll's built-in tasks with a custom task.

```js
var hekyll = require('hekyll');

hekyll(gulp_or_assemble, {
  task: 'hekyll', 
  theme: 'poole',
  themes: 'vendor',
  dest: 'src' //<= this will become your "handlebars" src templates
});
```

**Options**

* `task`: the task name to use for running hekyll. Default is `hekyll`
* `theme`: the name of the liquid theme to migrate. Example: `poole`
* `themes`: the parent directory of the liquid theme. Example: `themes`. This is joined to the `theme` name at build time.
* `dest`: the destination path for the converted theme.

### Gulp example

Download a theme:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/poole/poole.git themes/poole
```

Then build with gulp:

```js
var gulp = require('gulp');

hekyll(gulp, {
  task: 'hekyll', 
  theme: 'poole',
  themes: 'themes',
  dest: 'src' //<= this will become your "handlebars" src templates
});

gulp.task('default', ['hekyll']);
```

### Assemble example

Download a theme:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/poole/poole.git themes/poole
```

Then build with gulp:

```js
var assemble = require('assemble');
var app = module.exports = assemble();

hekyll(app, {
  task: 'hekyll', 
  theme: 'poole',
  themes: 'themes',
  dest: 'src' //<= this will become your "handlebars" src templates
});

app.task('default', ['hekyll']);
```

## Choosing a theme

~20 jekyll themes were tested during the creation of this library, including all of the [poole/poole themes](https://github.com/poole/poole) from [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo), and all of the built-in [gh-pages themes](https://pages.github.com/themes/). Most themes convert flawlessly, but some have nuances that might require some manual editing.

**Handlebars helpers**

To be able to render the migrated templates with handlebars, you will first need to include any missing handlebars helpers that were converted from liquid filters and tags during the migration.

Here are some libraries that might be useful for this:

* [template-helpers](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/template-helpers) - generic helpers that can be used with any template engine.
* [handlebars-helpers](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers) - more than 150 handlebars helpers

**Bug reports**

If you find a bug or something that doesn't convert correctly, [please let me know](../../issues/new), I want this to work as seamlessly as possible.
